The game was created by Shachar Shomer, Aviad Cohen, Rinat Lantsman and I (with the former 2 as designers and the latter 2 as developers) as our 2nd game jam, over a 3 week period in the _Gaming Lab_ course as part of the _Bezalel_ Game Development and Design Minor of my Computer Science B.Sc. in _The Hebrew University_, Jerusalem, Israel.
